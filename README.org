* How to use:
** Requirements:
This project uses the c2logic compiler.
** Parts:
*** bring.c:
Finds empty units and fills them with whatever resource they are asking for.

Program a processor with links to a cell and nucleus. I recommend a hyper processor.
*** order_take.c:
Summons idle units, tells them what resource it wants, then dumps this resource in the vault

Program a processor with links to a memory cell and vault. Optionally to a message for debugging. No lower than logic processor.
*** hire.c:
Sets up units for use in this system. There still needs to be a configurable limit for how many units to steal.

Program a logic processor with links to a memory cell. Doesn't need to be fast so micro will do.
** Configuration:
Relevant comments and variables for configuration are in
- setup.c
- consts.h
